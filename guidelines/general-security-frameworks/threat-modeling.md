# Threat Modeling Framework

## Overview

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and addressing security risks in applications, systems, or infrastructure. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for conducting threat modeling across different types of projects.

## Threat Modeling Process

### 1. Define the Scope

- **System Overview**: Define what is being built or assessed
- **Assets**: Identify valuable assets that need protection
- **Trust Boundaries**: Determine where data crosses trust boundaries
- **External Dependencies**: Identify external systems and their interactions
- **User Roles**: Define different user types and their permissions

### 2. Identify Threats

- **Threat Actors**: Identify potential attackers and their motivations
- **Attack Vectors**: Determine how threat actors might attack the system
- **Threat Categories**: Categorize threats using frameworks like STRIDE
- **Attack Trees**: Create hierarchical representations of attack scenarios
- **Risk Scenarios**: Develop realistic threat scenarios

### 3. Analyze Vulnerabilities

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify weaknesses in the system
- **Attack Surface Analysis**: Map out all entry points to the system
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Examine how data moves through the system
- **Security Controls Assessment**: Evaluate existing security measures
- **Compliance Requirements**: Consider regulatory and standards requirements

### 4. Risk Assessment

- **Impact Analysis**: Determine the potential damage from each threat
- **Likelihood Estimation**: Estimate the probability of each threat
- **Risk Calculation**: Combine impact and likelihood to prioritize risks
- **Risk Matrix**: Visualize risks based on impact and likelihood
- **Risk Acceptance Criteria**: Define what level of risk is acceptable

### 5. Mitigation Planning

- **Control Selection**: Choose appropriate security controls
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop strategies to address identified risks
- **Implementation Planning**: Create a roadmap for implementing controls
- **Residual Risk Analysis**: Assess remaining risks after controls
- **Validation Methods**: Determine how to validate control effectiveness

### 6. Documentation and Communication

- **Threat Model Document**: Create comprehensive documentation
- **Risk Register**: Maintain a register of identified risks
- **Communication Plan**: Share findings with stakeholders
- **Integration with SDLC**: Incorporate findings into the development lifecycle
- **Continuous Improvement**: Plan for regular review and updates

## Threat Modeling Methodologies

### STRIDE Framework

**STRIDE** is a threat classification model developed by Microsoft:

- **Spoofing**: Impersonating something or someone
  - Mitigations: Strong authentication, digital signatures, anti-spoofing headers
  
- **Tampering**: Modifying data without authorization
  - Mitigations: Digital signatures, integrity checking, access controls
  
- **Repudiation**: Denying having performed an action
  - Mitigations: Digital signatures, secure logging, timestamps, audit trails
  
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposing information to unauthorized entities
  - Mitigations: Encryption, access controls, data minimization
  
- **Denial of Service**: Disrupting system availability
  - Mitigations: Rate limiting, resource quotas, redundancy, monitoring
  
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized capabilities
  - Mitigations: Least privilege, input validation, secure defaults

### PASTA Framework

**PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is a risk-centric methodology:

1. **Define Business Objectives**: Understand the business context
2. **Define Technical Scope**: Identify the technical components involved
3. **Decompose Application**: Break down the application into components
4. **Analyze Threats**: Identify threats to the application
5. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Identify weaknesses in the system
6. **Attack Analysis**: Model attack scenarios and their probability
7. **Risk Analysis and Mitigation**: Assess risks and develop countermeasures

### OCTAVE Framework

**OCTAVE** (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) focuses on organizational risk assessment:

1. **Build Asset-Based Threat Profiles**: Identify critical assets and threats
2. **Identify Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**: Evaluate the infrastructure for weaknesses
3. **Develop Security Strategy and Plans**: Create a comprehensive security plan

### DREAD Framework

**DREAD** is a risk assessment model that helps prioritize threats:

- **Damage Potential**: How much damage could occur
- **Reproducibility**: How easy it is to reproduce the attack
- **Exploitability**: How easy it is to execute the attack
- **Affected Users**: How many users would be impacted
- **Discoverability**: How easy it is to discover the vulnerability

## Threat Modeling Tools

- **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**: Visual tool for creating data flow diagrams and identifying threats
- **OWASP Threat Dragon**: Open-source threat modeling tool
- **IriusRisk**: Commercial threat modeling platform
- **pytm**: Python framework for threat modeling
- **ThreatSpec**: Code-integrated threat modeling
