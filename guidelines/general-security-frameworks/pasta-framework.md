# PASTA Security Framework

## Overview

The PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework is a risk-centric threat modeling methodology that aims to align technical security requirements with business objectives. Unlike other threat modeling approaches that focus primarily on technical aspects, PASTA incorporates business impact analysis and contextual risk evaluation.

## PASTA Methodology Stages

PASTA consists of seven stages that guide security teams through a comprehensive threat modeling process. Each stage builds upon the previous one to create a thorough understanding of risks and appropriate countermeasures.

### Stage 1: Define Business Objectives

**Purpose**: Understand the business context and objectives for the application or system.

**Activities**:
- Identify business objectives and drivers
- Define critical business processes
- Map applications to business functions
- Identify key stakeholders
- Determine business impact criteria

**Deliverables**:
- Business context document
- Critical asset inventory
- Business impact analysis

**Best Practices**:
- Involve business stakeholders early
- Focus on value proposition
- Link technical components to business processes
- Quantify business value where possible

### Stage 2: Define Technical Scope

**Purpose**: Define the technical landscape of the application.

**Activities**:
- Identify application components and dependencies
- Define application architecture
- Document technology stack
- Identify integration points
- Establish system boundaries

**Deliverables**:
- Application architecture diagram
- Technology stack documentation
- Infrastructure diagrams
- Integration mapping

**Best Practices**:
- Use standardized architecture notation
- Include all external dependencies
- Document legacy system integrations
- Include cloud services and third-party components

### Stage 3: Decompose Application

**Purpose**: Break down the application into its components for detailed analysis.

**Activities**:
- Create data flow diagrams
- Identify trust boundaries
- Document authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Map sensitive data flows
- Identify entry points

**Deliverables**:
- Detailed data flow diagrams
- Trust boundary documentation
- Entry/exit point catalog
- Data classification mapping

**Best Practices**:
- Use different levels of abstraction
- Focus on data flows across trust boundaries
- Document both logical and physical components
- Include user interaction flows

### Stage 4: Analyze Threats

**Purpose**: Identify potential threats to the application.

**Activities**:
- Research applicable threat agents
- Create attack trees
- Map threats to application components
- Use threat classification frameworks (STRIDE, CAPEC)
- Analyze attacker motivation and capability

**Deliverables**:
- Threat catalog
- Attack trees
- Threat-component mapping
- Threat agent profiles

**Best Practices**:
- Consider insider and outsider threats
- Reference industry-specific threat intelligence
- Include emerging threats
- Consider attacker sophistication levels

### Stage 5: Vulnerability Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Activities**:
- Review code for security issues
- Conduct vulnerability scans
- Perform penetration testing
- Review configuration settings
- Analyze design for security weaknesses

**Deliverables**:
- Vulnerability catalog
- Scan results
- Penetration test reports
- Code review findings

**Best Practices**:
- Combine automated and manual techniques
- Consider both technical and logical vulnerabilities
- Prioritize based on exploitability
- Include configuration and deployment vulnerabilities

### Stage 6: Attack Analysis

**Purpose**: Model attack scenarios and their probability.

**Activities**:
- Create attack scenarios
- Determine attack likelihood
- Simulate attack paths
- Calculate attack complexity
- Map attack vectors to vulnerabilities

**Deliverables**:
- Attack scenario catalog
- Attack probability matrix
- Attack path diagrams
- Attack complexity analysis

**Best Practices**:
- Use real-world attack patterns
- Consider chained attacks
- Evaluate detective and preventive controls
- Include time-to-exploit estimates

### Stage 7: Risk Analysis and Mitigation

**Purpose**: Assess risks and develop countermeasures.

**Activities**:
- Calculate risk scores
- Determine impact to business objectives
- Develop risk treatment options
- Create mitigation strategies
- Prioritize security controls

**Deliverables**:
- Risk register
- Risk treatment plan
- Security requirements
- Control recommendations
- Residual risk analysis

**Best Practices**:
- Link risks to business impact
- Consider risk appetite of organization
- Develop layered security controls
- Include verification and validation strategies
