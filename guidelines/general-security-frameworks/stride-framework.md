# STRIDE Security Framework

## Overview

The STRIDE framework is a threat modeling methodology developed by Microsoft to help identify and categorize security threats. STRIDE is an acronym representing six threat categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of applying the STRIDE framework to application security.

## The STRIDE Threat Categories

### 1. Spoofing (S)

**Definition**: Pretending to be someone or something else.

**Examples**:
- Impersonating a user
- Pretending to be a trusted website
- Using stolen credentials
- DNS spoofing
- Email spoofing

**Security Properties Violated**: Authentication

**Common Vulnerabilities**:
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Password storage vulnerabilities
- Session management issues
- Lack of multi-factor authentication
- Missing identity verification

**Mitigations**:
- Strong authentication (multi-factor, biometric)
- Proper session management
- Digital signatures
- Anti-spoofing headers (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Certificate validation
- Secure credential storage

### 2. Tampering (T)

**Definition**: Modifying data or code without authorization.

**Examples**:
- Modifying data in transit
- Changing values in a database
- Manipulating input parameters
- Altering configuration files
- Code injection

**Security Properties Violated**: Integrity

**Common Vulnerabilities**:
- Missing input validation
- Insufficient transport encryption
- Inadequate access controls
- Client-side validation only
- Insecure direct object references

**Mitigations**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Message authentication codes (MACs)
- Digital signatures
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Integrity checking
- Access controls
- File permission restrictions

### 3. Repudiation (R)

**Definition**: Denying having performed an action, with no way to prove otherwise.

**Examples**:
- User denying a transaction
- Attacker claiming they didn't attack a system
- Denying authorship of a message
- Claiming data was altered by someone else

**Security Properties Violated**: Non-repudiation

**Common Vulnerabilities**:
- Insufficient logging
- Unprotected log files
- Missing audit trails
- Lack of digital signatures
- Inadequate timestamp mechanisms

**Mitigations**:
- Secure audit trails
- Comprehensive logging
- Digital signatures
- Timestamps from trusted sources
- Secure log management
- Transaction signing
- Blockchain for critical transactions

### 4. Information Disclosure (I)

**Definition**: Exposure of information to unauthorized individuals.

**Examples**:
- Exposing sensitive data in error messages
- Unintended data leaks through APIs
- Directory traversal exposing files
- Insufficient access controls
- Metadata leakage

**Security Properties Violated**: Confidentiality

**Common Vulnerabilities**:
- Verbose error messages
- Missing encryption
- Insecure direct object references
- Improper access controls
- Missing header protections
- Caching of sensitive information

**Mitigations**:
- Data encryption (in transit and at rest)
- Proper access controls
- Data classification
- Sanitized error messages
- Security headers (Content-Security-Policy)
- Privacy by design
- Data minimization

### 5. Denial of Service (D)

**Definition**: Making a system or application unavailable.

**Examples**:
- Flooding a network with traffic
- Resource exhaustion attacks
- Application logic flaws causing crashes
- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
- Database connection pool exhaustion

**Security Properties Violated**: Availability

**Common Vulnerabilities**:
- Missing resource limits
- Inefficient algorithms
- Lack of throttling
- Single points of failure
- Improper error handling

**Mitigations**:
- Rate limiting
- Resource quotas
- Load balancing
- Scalable architecture
- Graceful degradation
- Traffic filtering
- DDoS protection services
- Efficient resource management

### 6. Elevation of Privilege (E)

**Definition**: Gaining unauthorized access to resources or capabilities.

**Examples**:
- Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain admin rights
- Bypassing authorization checks
- Horizontal privilege escalation
- Vertical privilege escalation
- Buffer overflows leading to code execution

**Security Properties Violated**: Authorization

**Common Vulnerabilities**:
- Missing authorization checks
- Insecure direct object references
- Broken access control
- Path traversal
- Command injection
- Role confusion

**Mitigations**:
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Input validation
- Proper authorization checks
- Secure configuration
- Sandboxing
- Separation of duties
- Regular security updates

## STRIDE Analysis Process

### Step 1: System Decomposition
- Create data flow diagrams
- Identify components, data flows, entry points, and trust boundaries
- Document interactions with external systems

### Step 2: Threat Identification
- Analyze each component against all STRIDE categories
- Determine which threats are applicable to each component
- Create a threat table mapping components to applicable threats

### Step 3: Threat Analysis
- Evaluate each identified threat
- Determine attack vectors and potential impact
- Assess likelihood of occurrence

### Step 4: Risk Assessment
- Calculate risk based on impact and likelihood
- Prioritize threats based on risk level
- Identify acceptable vs. unacceptable risks

### Step 5: Mitigation Planning
- Develop countermeasures for each threat
- Document mitigation strategies
- Assign ownership and timelines

### Step 6: Validation and Testing
- Verify mitigations are effective
- Test security controls
- Update threat model as needed
