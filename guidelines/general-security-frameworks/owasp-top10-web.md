# OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks

## Overview

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

## Top 10 Web Application Security Risks (2021)

1. **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**
   - Vulnerabilities: Improper access restrictions, insecure direct object references, CORS misconfiguration
   - Prevention: Implement least privilege, deny by default, enforce record ownership, disable directory listing
   - Detection: Static/dynamic analysis, penetration testing, manual code review

2. **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**
   - Vulnerabilities: Weak encryption, sensitive data transmission in clear text, insecure protocols
   - Prevention: Use strong encryption algorithms, proper key management, HTTPS everywhere
   - Detection: Network traffic analysis, static analysis, secure configuration review

3. **A03:2021 - Injection**
   - Vulnerabilities: SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP injection vulnerabilities
   - Prevention: Use parameterized queries, ORMs, input validation, escaping special characters
   - Detection: Static/dynamic analysis, manual code review, fuzz testing

4. **A04:2021 - Insecure Design**
   - Vulnerabilities: Missing security controls, insecure business logic, inadequate threat modeling
   - Prevention: Secure SDLC, threat modeling, secure design patterns
   - Detection: Architecture reviews, threat modeling exercises, risk assessment

5. **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**
   - Vulnerabilities: Default credentials, error handling revealing stack traces, unnecessary features enabled
   - Prevention: Hardened configuration, minimal platform, automated verification
   - Detection: Configuration scanning, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing

6. **A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
   - Vulnerabilities: Unpatched libraries, outdated frameworks, vulnerable dependencies
   - Prevention: Dependency scanning, software composition analysis, patch management
   - Detection: Dependency checking tools, version scanners, vulnerability databases

7. **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures**
   - Vulnerabilities: Weak passwords, session fixation, inadequate session management
   - Prevention: Multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, proper session handling
   - Detection: Authentication testing, session management review, credential stuffing testing

8. **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures**
   - Vulnerabilities: Unsigned code, insecure CI/CD pipelines, auto-updates without validation
   - Prevention: Digital signatures, integrity checking, secure build processes
   - Detection: Software composition analysis, integrity verification, build process review

9. **A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
   - Vulnerabilities: Insufficient logging, unclear logs, inadequate monitoring
   - Prevention: Implement logging for key events, centralized log management, effective monitoring
   - Detection: Log coverage assessment, alert testing, incident response testing

10. **A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    - Vulnerabilities: Unvalidated URLs in requests, no network segmentation, excessive permissions
    - Prevention: URL validation, firewall rules, network segmentation
    - Detection: Penetration testing, code review, network monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Threat Modeling**: Perform threat modeling early in the development process
2. **Secure Coding Standards**: Establish and enforce secure coding standards
3. **Security Testing**: Implement automated and manual security testing
4. **Third-Party Components**: Regularly audit and update third-party components
5. **Security Training**: Provide regular security training for development teams
