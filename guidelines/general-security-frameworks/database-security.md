# Database Security Guidelines

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive security recommendations for database design, implementation, and management across various database technologies. These guidelines help organizations protect their data from unauthorized access, ensure data integrity, and maintain confidentiality.

## Key Database Security Principles

1. **Least Privilege**
   - Assign minimal permissions needed for each user/role
   - Regularly review and audit permissions
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Use stored procedures to limit direct table access

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement strong authentication mechanisms
   - Use multi-factor authentication for sensitive databases
   - Avoid shared accounts and credentials
   - Implement proper session management

3. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt data at rest using industry-standard algorithms
   - Implement transport layer security (TLS/SSL) for data in transit
   - Use column-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Properly manage encryption keys

4. **Input Validation and Parameterization**
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Implement proper error handling to avoid information disclosure
   - Use ORMs with security features

5. **Auditing and Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive database audit logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activities and access patterns
   - Implement alerts for potential security events
   - Regularly review audit logs

6. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Implement regular backup procedures
   - Encrypt backup files
   - Test restoration procedures
   - Store backups securely, preferably off-site

7. **Patch Management**
   - Keep database software updated with security patches
   - Test patches in non-production environments first
   - Document patch management procedures
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities

8. **Database Hardening**
   - Remove unnecessary features and services
   - Close unused ports and limit network access
   - Use secure configuration templates
   - Disable default accounts or change their credentials

## Database-Specific Security Guidelines

### SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)

1. **Access Control**
   - Implement row-level security where applicable
   - Use views to restrict access to sensitive data
   - Implement proper schema permissions

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Prevent DoS attacks through query optimization
   - Implement query timeouts
   - Use connection pooling efficiently

3. **Security Features**
   - Enable transparent data encryption (TDE) where available
   - Implement database firewalls
   - Use native security features (e.g., PostgreSQL RLS)

### NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)

1. **Authentication**
   - Always enable authentication
   - Use strong, unique credentials
   - Implement role-based access control

2. **Network Security**
   - Bind to localhost or internal IPs only
   - Use VPC/network segmentation
   - Implement proper firewall rules

3. **Encryption**
   - Enable encryption at rest
   - Configure TLS/SSL properly
   - Protect configuration files with sensitive information

### Data Warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery)

1. **Access Management**
   - Implement column-level security
   - Use data masking for sensitive information
   - Leverage cloud provider security features

2. **Data Governance**
   - Implement data classification
   - Track data lineage
   - Apply retention policies

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive auditing
   - Monitor query patterns
   - Set up alerts for unusual access patterns

## Security Testing for Databases

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Regularly scan databases for known vulnerabilities
   - Check for misconfigurations
   - Validate security settings

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - Conduct regular penetration tests
   - Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Attempt privilege escalation

3. **Configuration Review**
   - Review database configuration against best practices
   - Check for default or weak credentials
   - Verify encryption settings
