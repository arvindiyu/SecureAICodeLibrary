# OWASP API Security Top 10

## Overview

The OWASP API Security Top 10 focuses on the most critical security risks specifically related to APIs. This guide helps developers understand and mitigate the most common API security vulnerabilities.

## API Security Top 10 Risks (2023)

1. **API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization**
   - Vulnerability: APIs tend to expose endpoints handling object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface for object level access control issues
   - Prevention: Implement object-level authorization checks for all API methods, validate user permissions for requested objects
   - Detection: Penetration testing, authorization testing with different user roles

2. **API2:2023 - Broken Authentication**
   - Vulnerability: Authentication mechanisms implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or exploit implementation flaws
   - Prevention: Use standard authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT), implement proper token validation and expiration
   - Detection: Authentication mechanism testing, token handling review, session management testing

3. **API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization**
   - Vulnerability: Exposing sensitive object properties to users who shouldn't access them, even if object-level authorization is properly enforced
   - Prevention: Filter object properties based on user permissions, apply property-level access controls
   - Detection: Response payload analysis, property-level authorization testing

4. **API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption**
   - Vulnerability: Lack of resource quotas and rate limiting, leading to denial of service or increased operational costs
   - Prevention: Implement rate limiting, throttling, quotas, and validate payload sizes
   - Detection: Load testing, API abuse testing, resource consumption monitoring

5. **API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization**
   - Vulnerability: Complex access control policies with missing authorization checks
   - Prevention: Implement function-level authorization checks for all API functions, deny by default
   - Detection: Authorization testing, role-based access control testing

6. **API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows**
   - Vulnerability: Business flows that can be abused through automated scripts (e.g., ticket purchasing, account creation)
   - Prevention: Implement anti-automation controls, CAPTCHA, behavioral analysis
   - Detection: Automation testing, business logic testing

7. **API7:2023 - Server Side Request Forgery**
   - Vulnerability: API accepting user-supplied input to make requests to other internal or external services
   - Prevention: Validate and sanitize all inputs used for server-side requests, implement URL allowlisting
   - Detection: SSRF testing, code review, network monitoring

8. **API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration**
   - Vulnerability: Insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage
   - Prevention: Hardened configuration, automated configuration verification, minimal platform
   - Detection: Configuration scanning, vulnerability scanning

9. **API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management**
   - Vulnerability: Outdated or undocumented APIs, lack of inventory of hosts and deployed API versions
   - Prevention: API inventory and documentation, decommissioning strategy, API gateway
   - Detection: API discovery, documentation review, version management assessment

10. **API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs**
    - Vulnerability: Consuming third-party APIs without validating responses or handling errors properly
    - Prevention: Validate third-party API responses, handle errors gracefully, implement circuit breakers
    - Detection: Third-party API integration testing, error handling review

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to enforce consistent security controls
2. **API Inventory**: Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all APIs
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
5. **Output Encoding**: Encode all outputs to prevent injection attacks
6. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. **Monitoring & Logging**: Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring
