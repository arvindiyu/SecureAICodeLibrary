# Security Guidelines

This directory contains comprehensive security guidelines and framework documentation to help you understand and implement secure coding practices across various technologies and security domains.

## General Security Frameworks

The `general-security-frameworks` directory contains detailed documentation on widely used security frameworks and methodologies:

### OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
A standard awareness document for developers and web application security, representing a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

### OWASP API Security Top 10
A document that focuses on the most critical security risks specifically related to APIs, helping developers understand and mitigate the most common API security vulnerabilities.

### OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications
A specialized document addressing the unique security risks associated with applications leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) technologies.

### Database Security Guidelines
Comprehensive security recommendations for database design, implementation, and management across various database technologies.

### Threat Modeling Framework
A structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and addressing security risks in applications, systems, or infrastructure.

### STRIDE Security Framework
A threat modeling methodology developed by Microsoft to help identify and categorize security threats across six categories: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

### PASTA Security Framework
The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) framework, a risk-centric threat modeling methodology that aligns technical security requirements with business objectives.

## Using These Guidelines

These guidelines should be used to:

1. **Educate Development Teams**: Provide foundational knowledge about security frameworks and methodologies
2. **Guide Security Reviews**: Serve as a reference during code and architecture reviews
3. **Inform Security Requirements**: Help establish security requirements for new projects
4. **Support Threat Modeling**: Provide structure for threat modeling exercises
5. **Guide Remediation**: Assist in addressing identified security issues

## Integration with Secure Coding Prompts

These guidelines are designed to work in conjunction with the secure coding prompts found in the `prompts` directory. The guidelines provide the theoretical foundation and context, while the prompts offer practical implementation guidance.

## Contributing

To contribute new guidelines or improve existing ones, please ensure your content is:

1. **Accurate**: Based on current industry standards and best practices
2. **Comprehensive**: Covers the topic thoroughly with appropriate depth
3. **Practical**: Includes actionable guidance and examples
4. **Structured**: Follows a clear, consistent format
5. **Referenced**: Cites authoritative sources where appropriate
