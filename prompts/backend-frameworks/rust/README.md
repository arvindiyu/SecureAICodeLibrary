# Rust Security Prompts

This directory contains prompts for secure Rust programming. These prompts are designed to help developers leverage Rust's safety features while also addressing security concerns that the compiler cannot protect against.

## Available Prompts

1. [Rust Security Best Practices](./rust-security.md) - Comprehensive guide for writing secure Rust code

## Usage

Each prompt file contains:

1. A detailed prompt for GitHub Copilot to generate secure Rust code
2. Example implementations showing secure patterns
3. Security testing guidelines for Rust
4. Common security pitfalls in Rust development

Use these prompts when developing Rust applications to ensure that you're taking advantage of Rust's safety features while also addressing other security concerns.
