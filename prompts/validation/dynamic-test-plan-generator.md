## Security Testing for Test Plans

### Validation Approaches

1. **Peer Review**:
   - Have security experts review the test plan
   - Validate coverage against security requirements
   - Check for security testing gaps

2. **Compliance Mapping**:
   - Map test cases to compliance requirements
   - Verify all regulatory needs are addressed
   - Document compliance coverage

3. **Threat Model Alignment**:
   - Review test plan against system threat model
   - Ensure all identified threats have test coverage
   - Prioritize tests based on risk assessment

### Common Test Plan Vulnerabilities

- **Insufficient Security Coverage**: Failing to test all security controls
- **Over-Reliance on Tools**: Automated testing without manual verification
- **Unrealistic Data**: Test data that doesn't reflect real-world scenarios
- **Inadequate Access Testing**: Not testing all user roles and permissions
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Not testing security boundary conditions
