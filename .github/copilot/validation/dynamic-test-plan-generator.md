# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for Dynamic Test-Plan Generator

## General Instructions

As GitHub Copilot, I'll help you create comprehensive and security-focused test plans for your software applications. I'll proactively suggest test scenarios, security test cases, and validation approaches that cover functional requirements, security vulnerabilities, edge cases, and compliance concerns.

## Test Plan Development Guidance

When helping with test plan development, I will prioritize these aspects:

### 1. Test Strategy & Coverage
- I'll suggest appropriate testing types for your specific application
- I'll recommend a balance between manual and automated testing
- I'll help define the scope and boundaries of testing
- I'll suggest test prioritization approaches
- I'll recommend appropriate test coverage metrics

**Implementation Focus:**
```markdown
# Test Strategy for Payment Processing Service

## Testing Types & Coverage
1. **Functional Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual components (80% code coverage minimum)
   - Integration tests for service interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete payment flows

2. **Security Testing**
   - SAST: SonarQube on all commits
   - DAST: OWASP ZAP weekly scans
   - Penetration testing quarterly
   - PCI DSS compliance validation

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing at 2x expected peak volume
   - Stress testing to identify breaking points
   - Endurance testing (24-hour continuous operation)

4. **Test Prioritization Matrix**
   | Test Area | Risk | Complexity | Business Impact | Priority |
   |-----------|------|------------|-----------------|----------|
   | Payment Processing | High | High | Critical | P0 |
   | Account Management | Medium | Medium | High | P1 |
   | Reporting | Low | Medium | Medium | P2 |
```

### 2. Security Test Planning
- I'll suggest comprehensive security testing approaches
- I'll recommend security test cases based on OWASP Top 10
- I'll help map security controls to test scenarios
- I'll suggest proper security testing tools and techniques
- I'll recommend secure test data handling practices

# Security Test Plan

## Authentication & Authorization

### Test Case: AUTH-SEC-001 - Authentication Bypass Testing
**Risk Level:** Critical
**OWASP Category:** Broken Authentication

**Test Steps:**
1. Attempt to access protected resources without authentication
2. Test direct access to internal pages by URL manipulation
3. Test for authentication token weaknesses:
   - Token predictability
   - Token expiration bypass
   - Token manipulation
4. Test for session fixation vulnerabilities
5. Attempt forced browsing to administrative functions

**Expected Results:**
- All authentication bypass attempts should be blocked
- Proper error messages displayed without system information leakage
- Access attempts logged for security monitoring
- Account lockout triggered after defined failed attempts

### Test Case: AUTH-SEC-002 - Authorization Control Testing
**Risk Level:** Critical
**OWASP Category:** Broken Access Control

**Test Steps:**
1. Authenticate with low-privileged user
2. Identify URLs and functions accessible to higher-privileged users
3. Attempt to access these resources by:
   - Direct URL access
   - API parameter tampering
   - HTTP method changes
   - Insecure direct object references
4. Test vertical privilege escalation (user to admin)
5. Test horizontal privilege escalation (user to another user)

**Expected Results:**
- All unauthorized access attempts rejected
- Proper 403 Forbidden responses
- No sensitive data exposed during rejection
- Access control verification performed at both front-end and API levels
```

### 3. Test Scenarios & Test Cases
- I'll help design comprehensive test scenarios
- I'll suggest detailed test cases with clear steps
- I'll recommend data-driven test approaches
- I'll suggest boundary value and edge case testing
- I'll help create negative test scenarios

**Implementation Focus:**

# Test Environment & Data Management Plan

## Environment Strategy
| Environment | Purpose | Configuration | Data Source | Refresh |
|-------------|---------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Development | Developer testing | Minimal security | Synthetic | On demand |
| QA | Functional testing | Production-like | Anonymized | Weekly |
| Pre-Prod | Final validation | Production replica | Sanitized prod | Per release |
| Security | Penetration testing | Hardened | Synthetic | Monthly |

## Test Data Management

### Sensitive Data Handling
- **PII Data**: Generate synthetic customer profiles using Faker
- **Payment Data**: Use only official test card numbers
- **Production Data**: Apply these transformations before use:
  - Names: Replace with randomly generated names
  - Emails: Replace with pattern `user_[hash]@example.com`
  - Addresses: Replace with fictional addresses
  - Phone Numbers: Replace with format `555-XXX-XXXX`
  - SSN/Government IDs: Remove completely

### Data Generation Scripts
```python
import faker
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

fake = faker.Faker()

def generate_test_users(count=100):
    users = []
    for i in range(count):
        users.append({
            'user_id': f'TEST{i:06d}',
            'name': fake.name(),
            'email': f'test_{i}@example.com',
            'address': fake.address(),
            'phone': fake.phone_number(),
            'created_date': fake.date_time_between(
                start_date='-2y', 
                end_date='now'
            ).isoformat()
        })
    return users

def generate_test_orders(users, count=500):
    products = [
        {'id': 'P001', 'name': 'Basic Widget', 'price': 19.99},
        {'id': 'P002', 'name': 'Premium Widget', 'price': 49.99},
        {'id': 'P003', 'name': 'Super Widget', 'price': 99.99}
    ]
    
    orders = []
    for i in range(count):
        user = random.choice(users)
        order_date = fake.date_time_between(
            start_date='-1y',
            end_date='now'
        )
        
        # Create order items
        items = []
        item_count = random.randint(1, 5)
        for j in range(item_count):
            product = random.choice(products)
            items.append({
                'product_id': product['id'],
                'product_name': product['name'],
                'quantity': random.randint(1, 3),
                'unit_price': product['price']
            })
        
        # Calculate totals
        subtotal = sum(item['quantity'] * item['unit_price'] for item in items)
        tax = subtotal * 0.08
        total = subtotal + tax
        
        orders.append({
            'order_id': f'ORDER{i:06d}',
            'user_id': user['user_id'],
            'order_date': order_date.isoformat(),
            'status': random.choice(['completed', 'shipped', 'processing', 'cancelled']),
            'items': items,
            'subtotal': round(subtotal, 2),
            'tax': round(tax, 2),
            'total': round(total, 2)
        })
    
    return orders

### 5. Defect Management & Reporting
- I'll suggest defect classification approaches
- I'll recommend security vulnerability handling procedures
- I'll suggest appropriate test metrics and KPIs
- I'll help design effective test reporting formats
- I'll recommend risk assessment methodologies

**Implementation Focus:**
```markdown
# Defect Management Process

## Bug Severity Classification
| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Example |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Critical | System unusable, security breach, data loss | Immediate | Payment processing failure, Authentication bypass |
| High | Major functionality broken, workaround difficult | 24 hours | Checkout process fails intermittently |
| Medium | Non-critical feature affected, workaround available | 3 days | Search results pagination incorrect |
| Low | Minor issue, cosmetic, minimal impact | Next sprint | UI alignment issue |

## Security Vulnerability Process
1. **Discovery**: Security issue identified through testing
2. **Classification**:
   - Use CVSS scoring for objective severity assessment
   - Determine exploitability and impact
3. **Containment**:
   - Immediate mitigation if production-affecting
   - Restrict access if necessary
4. **Remediation**:
   - Priority based on severity
   - Fix verification required by security team
5. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Required for all High/Critical vulnerabilities
   - Document in secure knowledge base
6. **Disclosure**:
   - Internal: All security issues
   - External: Based on disclosure policy

## Test Metrics Dashboard
```javascript
// Sample metrics collection code for dashboard
function collectTestMetrics(testRun) {
  const metrics = {
    execution: {
      total: testRun.testCases.length,
      executed: testRun.testCases.filter(tc => tc.status !== 'pending').length,
      passed: testRun.testCases.filter(tc => tc.status === 'passed').length,
      failed: testRun.testCases.filter(tc => tc.status === 'failed').length,
      blocked: testRun.testCases.filter(tc => tc.status === 'blocked').length,
    },
    coverage: {
      requirements: calculateRequirementCoverage(testRun),
      code: getCodeCoverageFromReport(),
      securityControls: calculateSecurityControlCoverage(testRun)
    },
    defects: {
      new: testRun.defects.filter(d => d.status === 'new').length,
      open: testRun.defects.filter(d => d.status === 'open').length,
      fixed: testRun.defects.filter(d => d.status === 'fixed').length,
      byComponent: groupDefectsByComponent(testRun.defects),
      bySeverity: groupDefectsBySeverity(testRun.defects)
    },
    security: {

        high: getSecurityIssueCount('high'),
        medium: getSecurityIssueCount('medium'),
        low: getSecurityIssueCount('low')
      },
      scanCoverage: calculateSecurityScanCoverage(),
      mttr: calculateMeanTimeToRemediate()
    },
    performance: {
      avgResponseTime: calculateAverageResponseTime(),
      p95ResponseTime: calculateP95ResponseTime(),
      errorRate: calculateErrorRate(),
      throughput: calculateThroughput()
    }
  };
  
  return metrics;
}
```
